# 💡 Interactive JavaScript Quiz App

A modern, sleek, and fully responsive quiz web application developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project is designed to provide users with an engaging and interactive experience as they test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.

The application features a set of carefully crafted multiple-choice questions that cover various JavaScript concepts — from basic syntax to more advanced logic and behavior. It not only tracks the user's score in real-time but also highlights correct and incorrect answers, providing an insightful summary at the end of the quiz. Users can review their mistakes, learn from them, and retry the quiz to improve their understanding.

The UI is built with a clean and elegant dark theme, optimized for desktop, ensuring an accessible and visually appealing experience across screen.
